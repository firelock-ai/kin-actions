# Contributing to kin-actions

Thanks for your interest in kin-actions. This guide covers how to work with the
reusable workflows, the conventions this repository follows, and how to get
changes reviewed.

## Development Setup

kin-actions contains GitHub Actions reusable workflows — there is no compiled
artifact. To iterate locally, use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run
workflows against a local Docker runtime, or test against a fork.

Before opening a pull request:

- Lint workflow YAML with `actionlint` if available.
- Verify that any changed workflow can be consumed by at least one downstream
  caller in a fork/test environment.

## Versioning and Callers

Callers pin kin-actions to a semver tag. When a change to a reusable workflow
is breaking (changes inputs, outputs, or secret names), bump the version in
`VERSION` and create a new tag after merging. Non-breaking additions are safe
to merge without a tag bump — callers on older tags are not affected.

Callers reference workflows like:

```yaml
uses: firelock-ai/kin-actions/.github/workflows/cargo-registry-release.yml@v0.1.5
```

## DCO Sign-Off

This project uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). Every commit you push on a pull
request must carry a `Signed-off-by` trailer:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Add it by passing `-s` to `git commit`:

```sh
git commit -s -m "fix(hygiene): exempt bot identities from timestamp gate"
```

If you forgot to sign off earlier commits on your branch:

```sh
git commit -s --amend              # amend only the last commit
git rebase --signoff HEAD~N        # add sign-off to the last N commits
```

By signing off you certify that you wrote the code (or have the right to
submit it) and that it may be distributed under the Apache License 2.0 that
governs this repository. Bot-authored commits (Dependabot, GitHub Actions)
are exempt.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

Kin is built with significant AI assistance, and we welcome AI-assisted
contributions from the community. A few requirements:

- **You are responsible for AI-generated code you submit.** Review every
  line before opening a PR. If the model hallucinated a workflow step, an
  insecure secret reference, or a broken job dependency, that is your bug to
  catch.
- **AI-generated code is your contribution.** By signing off your commits
  you assert that you have reviewed the generated code and are submitting it
  under your own name.
- **No raw model output in commit messages or comments.** Clean up generated
  prose before it lands in public history.

## Commit Messages

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
A `type(scope): summary` subject is the expected shape:

```
fix(hygiene): exempt bot commits from author-identity check
feat(release): add optional dry-run input to cargo-registry-release
chore(version): bump to v0.1.6
```

Common types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, and `chore`. Write
the summary in the imperative mood and keep it focused on what changed and why.

## Branch Naming and Commit Hygiene

Public Git history is part of the product, so keep it clean and reviewable:

- **Keep branch names topical, not tracker-coded.** Prefer short, descriptive
  names like `fix/bot-exemption` or `feat/dry-run`. Avoid embedding internal
  issue or tracker IDs in a branch name.
- **Write durable subjects and bodies.** Commit messages should describe the
  technical change and why it was made. Keep internal tracker IDs, session
  identifiers, and automated authorship trailers out of public commit metadata.
- **Don't bypass the hooks.** Repository hooks normalize commit metadata for
  consistency — don't skip them with `--no-verify`.

## Pull Requests

- **Keep PRs scoped.** Stage only the files your change actually needs.
  Unrelated cleanups belong in their own PR.
- If a change is breaking (removes or renames inputs/outputs/secrets), update
  `VERSION` and note the breaking change in the PR description.

## Reporting Issues

File issues on [firelock-ai/kin-actions](https://github.com/firelock-ai/kin-actions/issues).

For security vulnerabilities, do **not** open a public issue. Follow the
private reporting process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Triage SLA: security issues are acknowledged within 48 hours; general issues
within 7 days.

## Repository Boundaries

kin-actions provides the CI/CD substrate shared by all Kin repositories. It has
no product logic — it enforces build hygiene, publication, and dependency
propagation. Semantic, graph, or inference changes belong in the owning crates
(`kin`, `kin-db`, `kin-infer`, and so on).
